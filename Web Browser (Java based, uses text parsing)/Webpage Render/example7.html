<body>

This is HTML your program should tokenize and render.
Be sure not to go over 80 characters on a line or the
text will go right off the window.
<br>

<P>Handling paragraphs
  even if they are different
            lines.</P><p> And the new
 paragraph starts in middle of the line.
 </p>
 
 Here comes a horizontal rule
 <HR>
 
 And handle breaks, like here.<br>With punctuation at break!<br>

For plain text, lest we forget <i>italic words</i>
and <B>bold statements</B>.<BR>

<p>For paragraphs too, we want
to have <b>bold comments
with words</b> and <i>italic
statements that could go to the next line</i>.</p>

Of course, we quote <q>Mr Greenstein</q>
<br>

Before a comment @<!--Here is a comment
on several lines
that ends here.-->And outside again

<br>
Now for something new!!!!
<H1>Huge header</h1>
<h2>Large header</H2>
<h3>Bold header that goes on and on
from one line to the other without any stopping and we could stop but
I want to test the length of the line.
</h3>
<h4>Bold medium header</h4>
<h5>Bold small header</h5>
<h6>Bold tiny header</h6>


<br> This     is 	the		 end 	of		 the file$</body>
